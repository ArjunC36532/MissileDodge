Simple 2D Single-Player Game

Use WASD to move your spaceship. As the game progresses, more enemy ships will appear to shoot you down. You can fight back using the F key to fire your missiles. Keep in mind that you can only shoot a maximum of 2 missiles at time, and your missiles wont recharge until they exit the screen.
